# SEG-Y

> 🚧👷🏻 This project is under active development, expect breaking changes
> the to API 👷🏻🚧
> _\- March, 2024_

This is an efficient and comprehensive SEG-Y parsing library.

See the [documentation][read the docs] for more information.

This is not an official TGS product.

## Features

The library utilizes `numpy` and `fsspec`, includes the reading from various local
and remote resources at a high speed. It also allows the users to build their own
SEG-Y specifications.

## Installing `segy`

Clone the repo and install it using pip:

Simplest way to install `segy` is via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```shell
$ pip install segy
```

or install `segy` via [conda] from [conda-forge]:

```shell
$ conda install -c conda-forge segy
```

> Extras must be installed separately on `Conda` environments.

For details, please see the [installation instructions]
in the documentation.

## Using `segy`

Please see the [Command-line Usage] for details.

For Python API please see the [API Reference] for details.

### Reading Capabilities

It supports reading from local and cloud files (object store). It can read:

- Sequential traces (fastest)
- Disjoint sequential regions (fast)
- Random traces (slow)

### High Performance

The performance is high and to be proven with upcoming benchmarks. The initial
subjective benchmarks is very acceptable.

### Flexibility

The library provides a fully flexible, schematized SEG-Y structure, including
data models and JSON schema parsing and validation.

### Predefined SEG-Y Standards

It supports predefined SEG-Y "standards" for various versions. However,
some versions are still in progress:

- [x] Rev 0 (1975)
- [x] Rev 1 (2002)
- [ ] Rev 2 (2017)
- [ ] Rev 2.1 (2023)

### Custom SEG-Y Standards

You can build your own SEG-Y "standard" with composition of specs for:

- Text header (file + extended)
- Binary header
- Traces (header + extended header + samples)

## Contributing to `segy`
